# The Azure AD Terraform provider switches to the Microsoft Graph API as of version 2.0.0, 
# so when version 2 is released you will need to grant permissions to the Microsoft Graph API 
# instead of to the Azure Active Directory Graph API.
# When adding permissions to your Service Principal, you need to add Application permissions 
# rather than Delegated permissions. This means that the Service Principal is 
# allowed to perform the specified actions as itself, rather than on behalf of another user.
# We will create two users and two groups and assign each user to a group
